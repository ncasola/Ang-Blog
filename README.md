Ang-Blog

Blog in AngularJS and PHP, with CRUD and Basic authentication


Install / Use
========

Clone the repository or download the zip.
To make it work you have to change the api/medoo.php file with the MYSQL connection data and put the Base Url in the index.html <base> tag
Import the angblog.sql with the basic data.

Important
========

I remove all the nodejs, bower stuff, i just want the AngularJS part, but this project is based on Angular Seed.
Other things I use is Slim Framework, Medoo, Underscore JS, Angular UI Bootstrap, and everything in the components folder.
